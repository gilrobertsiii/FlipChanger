# FlipChanger - Product Vision Document

## 1. Executive Summary

FlipChanger is an open-source application for the Flipper Zero device that helps users track physical CDs loaded into a CD changer system (supporting 3-200 discs). The application stores metadata similar to MP3 ID3 tags (artist, album, track listings) and associates this information with specific disc slots/positions. FlipChanger serves as both a practical utility and a learning project to understand the full application development lifecycle for Flipper Zero, including compliance with the official app store.

## 2. Purpose & Goals

### Primary Purpose
Enable Flipper Zero users to manage and track their physical CD collection when using a CD changer, storing metadata directly on the device for quick reference without needing a computer or mobile app.

### Learning Objectives
- Understand Flipper Zero application architecture
- Learn the Flipper Zero app store submission process
- Gain experience with repository management, version control, and open-source practices
- Explore Flipper Zero's infrared remote capabilities and existing IR database integration
- Build a foundation for future, more complex Flipper Zero applications

## 3. Target Audience

- **Primary Users**: Flipper Zero enthusiasts who own physical CD changers and want to track their CD collections
- **Secondary Users**: Developers/learners interested in Flipper Zero app development examples
- **Use Cases**:
  - Quick reference: "What CD is in slot 15?"
  - Collection management: Adding new CDs to the changer
  - Metadata lookup: Viewing track listings without ejecting discs

## 4. Key Features

### Core Features (v1.0)

| **Metadata Storage** | Store CD metadata per slot: Artist, Album, Year, Genre, Track listing (title, duration), Notes/Description | High |
| **View & Browse** | Navigate slots, view slot status (empty/occupied), display full metadata for loaded CDs | High |
| **Add/Edit CDs** | User-friendly interface to add or edit CD information for any slot | High |
| **Data Persistence** | Save all data to SD card or internal storage, survive device reboots | High |
| **Slot Status Indicators** | Quick visual indication of which slots are filled vs. empty | Medium |

### Enhanced Features (Future)

| Feature | Description | Priority |

| **IR Remote Integration** | Utilize Flipper Zero's infrared capabilities to control CD changer (play, pause, eject, select slot) using existing IR database | Medium |
| **Import/Export** | Import metadata from JSON/CSV files (via SD card or Flipper Lab), export for backup | Medium |
| **Search Function** | Search CDs by artist, album, or track name across all slots | Low |
| **Statistics** | View collection stats: total discs, by artist, by genre, etc. | Low |

## 5. Technical Specifications

### Platform & Language
- **Primary**: C (native Flipper Zero application) - recommended for performance and full feature access
- **Alternative Consideration**: JavaScript (via Flipper's mJS engine) - easier for iteration and learning

### Storage Architecture
- **Data Format**: JSON files stored on SD card or internal storage
- **Storage Location**: App-specific data folder (compliant with Flipper Zero app guidelines)
- **File Structure**: 
  - `flipchanger_data.json` - Main database file
  - Backup files for data recovery

### User Interface Constraints
- **Display**: 128x64 pixel monochrome LCD
- **Navigation**: D-pad (up/down/left/right) + Back button + OK/Select
- **Design Principles**: 
  - Simple, clear menu hierarchy
  - Minimal text, maximize information density
  - Scrollable lists for slots
  - Form-based data entry

### Data Model

```json
{
  "version": "1.0",
  "changer_capacity": 100,
  "slots": [
    {
      "slot_number": 1,
      "occupied": true,
      "cd": {
        "artist": "Artist Name",
        "album": "Album Title",
        "year": 2023,
        "genre": "Rock",
        "tracks": [
          {"number": 1, "title": "Track One", "duration": "3:45"},
          {"number": 2, "title": "Track Two", "duration": "4:12"}
        ],
        "notes": "Optional notes"
      }
    },
    {
      "slot_number": 2,
      "occupied": false,
      "cd": null
    }
  ]
}
```

### Infrared Integration (Optional)
- Leverage existing Flipper Zero IR database for CD changer remotes
- Potential commands: Play, Pause, Stop, Eject, Select Slot (1-N), Next/Previous Track
- Research phase: Identify common CD changer IR codes in Flipper database
