# FlipChanger

FlipChanger is an open-source application for the Flipper Zero that helps users track physical CDs loaded into a CD changer system (3-200 discs). Store metadata like artist, album, and track listings directly on your Flipper Zero, similar to MP3 ID3 tags.

## Features

- **Slot Management**: Track which CDs are in which slots (1-200)
- **Metadata Storage**: Store artist, album, year, genre, and track listings for each CD
- **View & Browse**: Navigate your collection easily on the Flipper Zero display
- **Add/Edit CDs**: Manage your collection directly from the device
- **Data Persistence**: All data saved to SD card, survives reboots
- **IR Remote Integration** (planned): Control your CD changer using Flipper Zero's infrared capabilities

## Status

✅ **Active Development** - Core features implemented and working! App builds, runs, and persists data successfully on Flipper Zero.

### Current Progress (January 2025)

- ✅ **Development Environment**: uFBT installed and configured
- ✅ **App Structure**: Complete C/C++ application structure
- ✅ **Core UI**: Main menu, slot browser, slot details view
- ✅ **Navigation**: Full menu system working
- ✅ **Memory Optimization**: SD card-based caching system (supports 200 slots)
- ✅ **Build System**: App builds and deploys successfully
- ✅ **JSON Storage**: Save/load functionality working
